## ClaudeCode Slash Commands

MD files placed in .claude/commands will be available as slash commands when using ClaudeCode. These are some I've been finding success with. I use Github Issues as my task queue and general repository for documents that Claude will interact with. It can read/write them via the Github CLI.
